/**

Create a GUI for this particular project. You can use the lab 4 solution that you’ve submitted.
Your GUI is completely up to you and should display all information that you find useful. It 
should be intuitive and informative.
Create a program that keeps track of specific information for Students. The information stored 
should be the following:
First Name, Last Name, Major, GPA, UIN, NetID, Age, Gender,
For this simple program we will only need to store 10 students in an ArrayList. Your students 
should be stored in an object called Student.
You should be able to add, sort (by any column you chose) and remove Students in the ArrayList.
